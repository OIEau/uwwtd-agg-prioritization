# uwwtd-agg-prioritization

## Objective
In this file we describe the methodology for creating the deliverable 1 “List of priority agglomerations non-compliant with UWWTD (for Articles 3, 4 and / or 5 particularly) for 17 MS: BG, CY, CZ, EL, ES, FR, HR, HU, IT, LV, MT, PL, PT, RO, SI, SK, IE. Priority must be set based on the size of agglomerations and the environmental impact.”
The respective MS lists will be used as a benchmark for the assessment of enabling condition 2a.

## 	Calculation methodology
We will use two criteria for the ranking:
1.	As a proxy for “size of the agglomeration”, the importance of non-compliance of the agglomerations in the country (assessing the amount of the remaining effort necessary),
2.	The “environmental impact” the respective agglomerations may have on receiving water bodies.
The final rank will combine the ranking of both criteria. For either criterion we will gather the necessary information and transform them into scores to use for ranking.

2.1	Criterion 1 – Size of the agglomeration
For the first criterion, the SIIF provides the list of non-compliant agglomerations, linked treatment plant(s) if they exist and the linked discharge point(s). It also provides their size and the distance to target by Article for the two last reporting years 2014 and 2016. It also provides the WFD waterbody (2010 WFD waterbodies) to which the treated wastewater is discharged.

2.2	Criterion 2 – Environmental impact
For the second criterion, the “environmental impact”, the most relevant source of information is the reporting on the Water Framework Directive (WFD) which covers all freshwater categories but also transitional, coastal and marine water which may be influenced by waste water discharges. The most recent report is for the year 2016.
NOTA: As almost all waste water treatment plants discharge in surface water (only a few plants located in Italy discharge in groundwater), only information relevant for surface water is considered in the following. 

We will use a mix of different data points for defining and assessing environmental impact.
